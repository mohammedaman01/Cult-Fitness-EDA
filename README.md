📊 Cult Fitness Data Analysis (EDA Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Cult Fitness dataset using Python.
The objective is to understand the dataset structure, clean the data, handle inconsistencies, and prepare it for further analytics or machine learning tasks.

The analysis emphasizes data quality, feature understanding, and pattern identification, which are critical steps before any predictive modeling.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset

Identify and handle missing values

Detect and treat outliers

Correct data types and inconsistencies

Perform feature-level analysis using visualizations

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to fitness users and memberships, including:

Demographic details
